# Hiring Automation Crew - Comprehensive Guide
![TalentMatchAI](TalentMatchAI.png)
## 🎯 Project Overview

This is an AI-powered hiring automation system built with CrewAI that streamlines the recruitment process. The system uses intelligent agents to analyze candidate resumes against job descriptions, make hiring decisions, and automatically manage documentation in Google Sheets and Google Docs.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

The system is built on the **CrewAI framework**, which orchestrates multiple AI agents working together to complete complex tasks. Here's how it works:

- **Multi-Agent System**: Different AI agents with specialized roles work collaboratively
- **Sequential Processing**: Tasks are executed in a specific order for optimal results
- **Tool Integration**: Agents use specialized tools to interact with external systems
- **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior defined through YAML configuration files

- Opens spreadsheet by ID
- Accesses first worksheet
- Appends new row with candidate data
```

**Input**: 
- Candidate name
- Qualification reason/rejection reason

**Output**: Confirmation of successful data append

**Background Process**:

**Input**:
- Candidate name
- Email address
- Skills list
- Education details
- Experience information

**Output**: Formatted candidate profile in Google Doc

**Background Process**:
1. Google Docs API authentication
2. Document access and content retrieval
3. Text formatting with visual elements
4. Content insertion at proper location
5. Document update and save

## 🔄 Workflow Process

### Task 1: HR Recruiter Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze resume against job description and make hiring decision

**Process Flow**:
1. **Resume Reading**: PDF Reader Tool extracts text from resume file
2. **Content Analysis**: AI agent analyzes resume content for:
   - Skills and competencies
   - Experience level and relevance
   - Education background
   - Career progression
3. **Job Matching**: Compares candidate profile against job requirements:
   - Required experience (2 years for AI Developer)
   - Technical skills (Python, ML libraries)
   - Educational background
   - Preferred qualifications
4. **Decision Making**: Makes binary decision (Qualified/Rejected)
5. **Documentation**: If qualified, logs to Google Sheets

**AI Processing**:
- Natural language processing of resume text
- Semantic matching between skills and requirements
- Experience quantification and validation
- Competency scoring and threshold evaluation

### Task 2: Google Docs Documentation

**Objective**: Create detailed candidate records for qualified candidates

**Process Flow**:
1. **Conditional Execution**: Only runs if candidate is qualified
